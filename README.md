Sally Ride Multimedia Submission

# What inspired you to pursue a career in aerospace (your aha! moment), and how do you envision your contributions shaping the future of the industry?
For my multimedia submission I created a python script that produces an interactive star map for the prompt of "What inspired you to pursue a career in aerospace (your aha! moment), and how do you envision your contributions shaping the future of the industry?"

# How it Works
Click on the .py file to view the code and download the Meg_Wentz_Star_Map.html to see the interactive star map that I created with the code! Please note that the star map must be opened on a PC or desktop (not a phone) to properly view and load the file! 

Hope you enjoy!
