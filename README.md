Sally Ride Multimedia Submission

# What inspired you to pursue a career in aerospace (your aha! moment), and how do you envision your contributions shaping the future of the industry?
For my multimedia submission I created a python script that produces an interactive star map for the prompt of "What inspired you to pursue a career in aerospace (your aha! moment), and how do you envision your contributions shaping the future of the industry?"

# How it Works
Click on the .py file to view the code and download the Meg_Wentz_Star_Map.html to see the interactive star map that I created with the code! You will most likely have to download the .html file onto your computer because github has a hard time processing a large html file. Once it is download you will be able to open it and view it without anymore configuration or steps. Please note that the star map must be opened on a PC or desktop (not a phone) to properly view and load the file! 

Hope you enjoy!
